		this is just a place for myself where i document daily on something new i learned. i will also make this website more personal along the way, adding some features here and there. i aim the posts to be in an informative/teaching style so that if i wanted to, i could come back to them easily despite the fact ive been told countless times how im a bad teacher. also why not learn yourself something new today?
